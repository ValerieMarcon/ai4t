Although Artificial Intelligence Educational Resources -AIERs- are becoming increasingly common, there is currently no tool to comprehensively map the characteristics of AIERs and help users make informed use of these resources.

The LORIA[^1] Research Laboratory has designed a template for AI characterisation[^2] in order to help users, and here specifically teachers, to better understand the resources they or their students use.

Organised in different layers that cover all the features of the AIER, from usage scenarios to the transparency mechanism to explain the
decision proposed by the AI, this template is a tool to help better understand what makes up an AIER.

The Template in a ready-to-use format[^3] can also be uploaded and filled in for your own AI Educational tools and resources.
