The AI4T consortium has identified Duolingo for Schools as a relevant AI
tool to be experimented by teachers during the project.

It's a learning language App, for sure, but the question it raises as an
AIERs are relevant across disciplines.

During this activity, Duolingo for Schools is proposed as a case study
to experiment the Template for AI characterisation. There two
particularities of Duolingo for Schools that makes it's a good case
study:

1.  Duolingo shares a lot of info about how it works,

2.  Used by many learners, it has been the focus of many questions from
    outsiders concerned about privacy, for example. It is therefore
    easier to have insights about some issues that are generally not
    that easy to have about AIERs, like data protection.

## Duolingo for Schools in its own words 

Here is the official presentation of Duolingo for Schools on its

teacher's Duolingo account that allows them to create classrooms and
assignments, and to follow students' activity. We're excited to work
with educators to bring the world's number one language learning app
into classrooms, with features designed to maximize teacher
effectiveness and student learning*".
