Developed by the partners of the AI4T consortium and shaped par Inria
Learning Lab, all the contents of the Mooc are to be consulted and
reused according to your goals and needs.

The AI4T consortium has therefore agreed on a very open licence that
will allow you many opportunities to reuse the Mooc contents.
