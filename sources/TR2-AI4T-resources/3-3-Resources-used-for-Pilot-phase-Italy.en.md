## Tools used during webinars

-   ##### Teachable Machine[^1]: 

What: "*Teachable Machine is a web-based tool available to anyone, which
allows you to create machine learning models quickly and easily.* "

By: Google Creative lab

-   ##### QuickDraw[^2] 

What: "*This game is based on machine learning. You draw, and a neural
network tries to guess what your drawing represents. Of course, it
doesn\'t always succeed, but the more you play, the better the network
gets. So far we have taught it a few hundred concepts, and we hope to
add more over time. This game shows that machine learning can be fun*".

-   ##### Sketch_RNN[^3]

What: "*An interactive web experiment that lets you draw together with a
recurrent neural network model called
[sketch-rnn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03477). We taught this neural
net to draw by training it on millions of doodles collected from the
[Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data/) game. Once you
start drawing an object, sketch-rnn will come up with many possible ways
to continue drawing this object based on where you left off. Try the
[first
demo](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html).*"

-   ##### [[This person does not exist]{.ul}](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en)

What: "*Random Face Generator , Generate random human face in 1 click
and download it! AI generated fake person photos: man, woman or
child"."The AI face generator is powered by StyleGAN, a neural network
from Nvidia developed in 2018*."

-   ##### [[Let\'s play paper, scissors, stone]{.ul}](https://tenso.rs/demos/rock-paper-scissors/)

What: "*Play Paper; scissor and stone against your computer*". "*The
demo is built on (a)GPU-accelerated [TensorFire](https://tenso.rs/)
library for fully in-browser deep learning. It\'s fast enough to perform
real-time client-side classification of live webcam video, and we\'re
showing it off here with a cute little game.*"

By: Tensor Fire - "*a group of recent MIT graduates who all think this
whole "deep learning" thing is pretty neat*".
