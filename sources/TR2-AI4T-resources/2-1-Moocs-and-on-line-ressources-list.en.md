**AI4T Ressource -2-1- Moocs and other OnLine resources**


Many Massive Open Online Courses are dedicated to Artificial Intelligence.

Here is a selection of Moocs organised as follows

1 - AI in general

2 - and AI in education

Then a selection of online resources on AI and education are presented.
This is a partial selection, linked to the context and interest of the
AI4T project and the promises of the project. This list should therefore
evolve and be enriched. Most of the resources are available in English,
some are also available in other European languages. We have also
mentioned two resources that are not available in English as they play a
key role in the AI4T project.
