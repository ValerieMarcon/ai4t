## How to access specific resources

1. **Videos**  
  The videos are hosted with their english subtitles on the [AI4T YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBd_PgP_BdhmgdSzz5d83vQ) of the project created by the WP4 team. Videos files (mp4 format) as well as subtitles files (vtt or srt format) are unlisted (_therefore not visible_) but available if needed.

2. **Quizzes and interactive online activities**  
  Each module of the Mooc contains a set of quizzes and activities. They are hosted and presented on the website (https://inrialearninglab.github.io/ai4t/index.html).

  You can download them from this repository in 2 formats: html or h5p files.

  * Quizzes for all Modules

## How to translate the Mooc-V2 resources

1. **Texts**  
All texts files are accessible in HTML or Markdown format. Automatic translations (using the DeepL API) from the English Mooc-V2 version into the four languages of the consortium (DE, FR, IT, SL) are scheduled for delivery on November 15, 2022.

2. **Videos with Voice-Over**  
- All the videos (the previouly existing ones from Mooc V1 and those produced for Mooc V2) will be provided with voice-over in the 4 languages of the consortium (except German for the Mooc V1 videos as requested by Luxembourg partner).
The Voice-over videos and their associated subtitles are produced by a sub-contractor (MyGustav). For a more efficient interaction, each partner interacts directly with MyGustav to check and correct the translated voice scripts of each original video before the voice-over is recorded. Each voice-over is produced by a native speaker.
- All the videos ("Guillaume" character videos, tutorials videos, Mooc V2 new videos) for each language will be uploaded on the AI4T youTube Channel.

3. **Videos subtitles**
- Translated subtitles will be directly uploaded on the project AI4T YouTube channel by Inria as soon as they are produced by MyGustav.

4. **Tutorials**  
- Videos with voice-over will be integrated into the tutorials interface as soon as they are produced by MyGustav.
- Translated subtitles will be directly inserted in the tutorial by Inria as soon as they are produced by MyGustav.
