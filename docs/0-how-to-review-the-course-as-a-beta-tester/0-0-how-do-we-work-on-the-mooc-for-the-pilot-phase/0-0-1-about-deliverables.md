*   a **Project Glossary** that includes the deliverables of WP2 and their successive versions, in relation to the objectives and period of AI4T. This work can be linked to WP5 work on the projet Lexicon.

1.  Methodological Framework
2.  Synthesis on AI In Education
3.  Template on AI Characterization

Those elements are in a dedicated file "**Mooc V0 Beta test**" inside the WP2 Folder.
