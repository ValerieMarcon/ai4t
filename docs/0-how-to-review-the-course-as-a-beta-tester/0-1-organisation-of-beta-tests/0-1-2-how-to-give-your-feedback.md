### How to Give your Feedback

### 

We organized the feedbacks into 2 steps:

#### Step 1 objective: Co-construction of the Course organisation

Are Quiz, Questionnaires, or Professional learning communities relevant for O1 objective of Mooc V1?  
What changes in the organisation of the course or improvements in the articulation of content do you propose?

To give your Feedback, we suggest you use the **dedicated feedback area of "[What is in this course?](https://lms.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:inria+41029+session01/jump_to_id/63e1bc73b7984a8f903bf9b2ffe130e5)"** of the General Presentation Module **before July 16th**.

#### Step 2 objective: Co-construction of the Course contents

As we have seen, **each page** of the course has its own **feedback area**. We suggest that inside the "Feedback" areas you organise your work according to the following **grid**: 

*   **1- To be deleted**: resources you consider irrelevant, items you think have already been sufficiently covered.
*   **2 - To be modified**: if you have a proposal for a resource in English, please indicate it in the box provided and we will be happy to discuss it with all partners and add it. If you are not satisfied with any of the formulations or presentations, please also indicate it under this label.
*   **3- To be added**: the content needs to be completed, some concepts are not specific enough, so tell us what you think should be mentioned.
*   **4 - Details**: section to tell us about any typos, imperfect translations, non-existent or invalid links, any bugs you encounter
*   **5 - Other**: please feel free to give your opinion or recommendation on a topic that you feel does not belong in any of the above sections.

You can also use this grid, when relevant, to make your comment on the **Course contents.  
**

For this second step, your Feedbacks will be needed **before August 28th**.

#### An Opportunity to Collect Ressources for the Pilot Phase

You can also use the Beta tests to **identify resources in** **your national language** that will be relevant for the version of the Mooc V1 in German, English, French, Italian and Slovenian. 

Those resources can also **be shared** via the Feedbacks.
