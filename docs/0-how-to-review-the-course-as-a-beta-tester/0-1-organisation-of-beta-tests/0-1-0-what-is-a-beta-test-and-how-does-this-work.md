### What is a "beta-test" for this Mooc?

Beta test objective in the context of the Mooc V1
-------------------------------------------------

This beta test is the opportunity for us to show you:

1.  what is the Mooc for Objective 1 at its first step of internationalisation,
2.  andÂ collect your opinions, requests for improvement and proposals for resources.

âœ… We will ask you much more than we usually do with usual betatesting at Inria because this Mooc is in co-construction phase.

**Note : A beta test** is usually a process during which some customers are asked to use a piece of software etc. that is at the second stage development in order to see if there are any problems that have not been corrected ([Cambridge Dictionnary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/fr/dictionnaire/anglais/beta-test)).
