How to use the Forum?
---------------------

#### Access to the Discussion Forum

There are two ways to access the discussion forum:

1\. **A direct and easy access at the end of each page of the course  
**A forum is open on the topic covered in the current page.  
If you click on "**Show Discussion**", all the threads that belong to the topic will appear and you will be able to post a comment.  
If you click on "**New Post**", you will open a new thread.

2\. **A general access via the "Discussion" link in the top navigation bar  
**This will give you access to all the discussions available in the course.

#### Navigation & Contribution in the General Discussion Forum

### Left Pane

1 **Drop-down discussions list**: when you click this list, you can see all of the topics in the course discussions, or you can view only the posts that you’re currently following.  
2 **Status filter**: you can filter discussions that you haven’t read or that contain unanswered questions.   
3 **Post search box**: you can search all posts, responses, and comments for individual words or phrases.  
4 **Activity sorting contro**l: you can sort discussions by recent activity, most activity, or most votes.  
5 **Specific identifiers**:  if an instructor has pinned a post, if you’re following a post, or if the person who created the post is a community TA, moderator, or administrator, you’ll see a colored identifier with this information.

6 **“Correct answer” status indicator**: the green check mark indicates that one of the responses to the post correctly answers the question that the post asks.  
7 **Post type**: a post can be a question or a discussion.  
8 **Status indicators**: a grey indicator shows that you have read all the posts and the answers and comments for that post. A white indicator shows that you have read the post and that a new answer or comment has been posted. A blue indicator shows that you haven't read the post.

### Right Pane

To add a **new post** click on "_Discussion_" in the course navigation bar, then click on ![Bouton nouveau message](/static/forum-btn-nouveau-message.png) and complete the following elements.

1 **Post Type:** click **Question** or **Discussion** to select the type of post that you want to create. A _question_ post raises an issue so that the discussion staff or community can provide answers. A _discussion_ post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections, and inviting community participation.  
2 **Topic Area**: every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. The course team creates the list of discussion topics for each course, and you’ll choose a topic from the list when you create your post.  
3 **Title**: supply a short, descriptive title. The title is the part of your post that others see when they are browsing on the _Discussion_ page or scrolling through one of the content-specific topics.  
4 **Post content** : Enter the complete text of your post. To format the text or add links or images, click the buttons above the text field.  
5 **Follow this post**: check the box if you want to follow your post and access easily to the answers and comments that will be posted.
