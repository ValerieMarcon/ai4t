### Where to Give your Feedback

Your comments are collected in the forum whose access is distributed throughout the course pages.

One discussion per page
-----------------------

On the FUN platform, each page is known as a "Unit".  
A Forum Feedback Area has been inserted on the bottom of each page. Therefore you can make comment or recommandation for contents that are still on your screen.

At this end of each page you will find the following area:  
  
![](/static/Identification_of_Feedback_area_on_Mooc_V0_-_no_indications.png)  
  
We hope that this level of granularity will allow us to propose the best developments for the Mooc.
