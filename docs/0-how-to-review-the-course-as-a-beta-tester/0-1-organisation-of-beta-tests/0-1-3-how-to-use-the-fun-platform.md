If you are not familiar with the FUN platform or with Open edX, you will find below a quick introduction to the available functionnalities.

First of all, you should choose the English language in your [FUN account Settings](https://lms.fun-mooc.fr/account/settings), otherwise some of the FUN interface elements will be in French.

*   The  ![Check button](/static/CheckButton.png) button evaluates your responses. If the quiz is graded, clicking this button updates your score. If you have just one final submission remaining, this button is replaced by the  ![Final check button](/static/final-check.png) button.
*   The ![Save button](/static/SaveButton_EN.png) button saves your responses. This is useful for example if you haven't finished preparing your response to a question and you would like to watch again the video. You can also use it when you want to take a break. When you save your responses, the following message is displayed: "Your answers have been saved but not graded. Click 'Check' to grade them."
