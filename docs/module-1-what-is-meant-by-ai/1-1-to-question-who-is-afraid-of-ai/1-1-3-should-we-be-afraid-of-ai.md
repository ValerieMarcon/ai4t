### Should We Be Afraid of AI?

Translated text from the french IAI Mooc.

AI makes us dream as well as have nightmares. It must be said that it has greatly inspired science fiction, from "2001 : A Space Odyssey" to "Terminator" or more recently "Her", there is plenty to feed our imagination. However, many eminent scientists, such as Stephen Hawkings and Elon Musk, also warn us against the development of this discipline. So should we fear that AI will destroy humanity, or on the contrary should we see it as our salvation?

Of course, the reality is much less Manichean. First of all, we need to recontextualise things. Part of the fantasy about artificial intelligence stems from the collective imagination we have built up around it, i.e. that of super-intelligent machines or programmes capable of one day surpassing human beings; it's the good old myth of the singularity. In reality, **AI is not a technology, but a scientific discipline** with its own technological advances. Today, **programmes based on AI are more about "knowledge" through learning than real intelligence**. This raises questions about our ethics, particularly because, as we have seen, AI needs data to learn, and these are often personal data. So we should not get carried away, we are still a long way from programs that think for themselves (and besides, maybe we will never get there).

It is also necessary to recontextualise the concern of researchers and in particular the [AI Open Letter of January 2015](https://futureoflife.org/ai-open-letter) written by a dozen scientists. While in this letter, **the researchers warn of the potential risks of the development of AI, they also highlight the positive effects that it could have on humanity**. It is therefore in fact more informative than alarmist and aims above all to integrate ethical and societal issues into the heart of the debate. It is with this in mind that the international consortium [Partnership of AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/) was created, bringing together large companies (such as GAFA) as well as associations, NGOs and universities to ensure that the impact of AI on human societies remains at the heart of the debate.

Ultimately, **the definition of AI lies between myths, fantasies, scientific and technical innovations**, but for now, let's leave the myth of the singularity to fiction and focus on the scientific advances that already exist.
