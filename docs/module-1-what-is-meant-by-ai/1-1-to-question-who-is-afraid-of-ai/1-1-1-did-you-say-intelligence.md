### Did You say Intelligence?

_Translated text from the french IAI Mooc._

More than being unbeatable at mental arithmetic or Go, intelligence is the ability of a living system to understand, interpret, learn and adapt to change.

**To be intelligent is to know how to find the most appropriate response to a problem**, for which we rely on all our mental and cognitive faculties. Moreover, intelligence is embodied, it is something inseparable from our body. If we take the example of the game of Go, we use our intellect to adapt our game strategy to a situation, anticipate that of our opponent and find the best combination to win the game. But then, if in 2016 the Alpha Go program managed to beat the Korean Go champion, does that mean that computer programs are more intelligent than human intelligence?

In short, **what is the difference between the intelligence of a human being and that of a machine**?

While artificial intelligence is very impressive, it is still limited to a well-defined domain. Moreover, it is not embodied, unlike our biological intelligence embodied in a body. In the case of machine learning technologies, "intelligence"Â is based on learning and to do this it needs to make statistics on a lot of data, unlike our intelligence which can make relevant deductions from a few examples.  
Of course the machine is capable of performing calculations and processing information at a breakneck pace, but the machine does not understand the task you are asking it to perform.  
For example, if you ask a child to look for a picture of a dog in a picture book, the child will only need to see one or two pictures of a dog to be able to recognise the animal, even in an unusual situation (at night, for example).  
The child, beyond visualising what a dog might look like, will then be able to define and describe it, and even evoke possible emotional ties that he or she might have developed with the animal.  
An algorithm, on the other hand, will need hundreds of thousands of photos before it can recognise a dog without making a mistake.  
On the other hand, if you launch a search on the Internet with the word "dog", the search engine will be able to display hundreds of millions of images of dogs, without knowing what a dog is, nor defining it, nor describing it, nor explaining how it could have felt any emotion towards it.

Human or animal intelligence, biological intelligence, is based on cognitive and also emotional capacities, linked to the body. A so-called "strong" artificial intelligence, which would be able to be autonomous and versatile in unexpected situations, is a scientific objective. However, at present, there are results that show that this ideal goal of strong artificial intelligence is technically impossible. For the moment, this is a belief, not a future scientific revolution.
