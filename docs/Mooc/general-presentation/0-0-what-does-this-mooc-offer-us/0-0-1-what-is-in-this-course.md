This first part is dedicated to the acquisition of a first understanding of what is meant by Artificial Intelligence, what it is not and finally raises the question: What is intelligence ?

**Module 2: How does Machine Learning work?**

This third part deals with the problems of ethics and aims to understand the stakes and the levers for AI to be at the service of humans.

### Each module is articulated in 3 steps:

*   To Question Yourself: to move from preconceived ideas to questions on which to build understanding.
*   To Experiment: to perform activity (on line or not) and see by yourself.
*   To Discover: to understand how it works through the history of humans and their ideas.

### Videos and quizzes?

#### About videos

The Mooc offers several introducing short videos. Their objective is to arouse the participant's curiosity, make them want to know more, trigger a debate...
The scenario features a main character, Guillaume, who is questioning and seeking to know more about AI. Sometimes he talks on the phone with his cousin Theo and calls a fictitious hotline.
Participants should not be surprised by this non-academic style of the videos.

#### About quizzes

The Mooc offers quizzes at the end of each Module. Their objective is to reinforce the knowledge and skills acquired.
_Note_ : At the end of each quizz a passing score is displayed, which is a rating of your answers. This information is not taken into account in the Mooc pedagogical pathway (because there is no evaluation of learners).
