    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been built on the opposition between knowledge and data. Neuroscience has provided evidence to support this view but has also revealed that important properties of our cognition are based on strong interdependencies between these two concepts. However, AI remains stuck on its initial conceptions and will not be able to participate in this virtuous dynamic until it has integrated this differentiated vision.
