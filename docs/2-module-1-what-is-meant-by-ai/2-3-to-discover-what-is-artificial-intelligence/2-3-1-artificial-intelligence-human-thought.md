#### Artificial Intelligence and Human Thought

The original IAI Mooc featured an article on artificial intelligence and human thought published on www.lemonde.fr in May 2018. The beginning of the article has been translated below.  
New resource to be found and integrated if the topic is kept.

Still talking about artificial intelligence? In the midst of all the media noise on the subject, a researcher in education sciences, [Margarida Romero](https://margaridaromero. me/), will address a question that has rarely been asked and never been analysed in such depth: how to educate our fellow citizens in a world where "artificial intelligence" is becoming omnipresent? **Pascal Guitton & Thierry Viéville**.

Like any new technology, artificial intelligence is the subject of both hopes and fears, and what it covers today presents major challenges (Villani et al, 2018). It also raises profound questions about our own humanity. Will the machine overtake the intelligence of the humans who designed it? What will be the relationship between so-called artificial intelligences and our human intelligences?

The question is how to deal with this.

In a recent book, Jean-Gabriel Ganascia (2017) answers the first question: He shows very simply that a so-called artificial algorithmic intelligence is developing (he speaks of 'technical artificial intelligence'), whose performance is effectively turning our society upside down, as we are living in the time of algorithms (Abiteboul-Dowek, 2017). However, the idea of a strong artificial intelligence that would overtake the intelligence of humans is not a true or false idea, it is a belief because it is not supported by scientific arguments. It happens to be in the interest of those who dominate the digital market to make us believe it and of media outlets in terms of audience to relay this belief.

#### Critical thinking and creativity

So, before we worry about our competences in the face of this assumed world of artificial intelligences, let's say, AI to describe this belief, we'll name it the "AI"; In order to sign this belief, we must sharpen our key human skills: critical thinking and creativity. First of all, if we are to think critically, we should start by questioning the term AI. Is the term 'intelligence' relevant to describe computer applications based on machine learning? The aim of these algorithms is to develop systems capable of capturing, processing and reacting to (massive) information according to mechanisms that adapt to the context or data to maximise the chances of achieving the system's objectives. This behaviour, which may appear to be intelligent, was created by humans and has limitations related to the current human capacity to decipher and interpret data; The current human capacity to develop efficient machine learning systems is limited, as is the availability of massive amounts of data for the systems to adapt to. The observation is that these systems outperform humans on specific tasks such as sound recognition, image recognition or, recently, reading tests such as the [Stanford Question Answering Data Set](https://www.blogdumoderateur.com/ia-lecture-squad/). Does having a better reading test mean being able to understand, in a human and intelligent sense, the text being read? Statistical ability to identify answers may seem intelligent, but there is no evidence that it is in the critical and creative sense of humans.
