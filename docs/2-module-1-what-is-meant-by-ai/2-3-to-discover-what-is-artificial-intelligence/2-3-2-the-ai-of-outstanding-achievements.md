#### The AI of Outstanding Achievements

**_What is Said in the  [Inria White Paper](https://www.slideshare.net/INRIA/inria-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-current-challenges-and-inrias-engagement?ref=https://intranet.inria.fr/)_** _(access to the full document below)_

**AI has become a hot topic in the media and science magazines** due to numerous achievements, many of which are the result of advances in the field of machine learning.

AI research has made significant progress in the last decade in a variety of areas. The **best known advances are those in machine learning**, thanks in particular to the development of deep learning architectures, multi-layer convolutional neural networks that learn from large volumes of data on intensive computing architectures.

**Some notable examples** **:**

*   **solving Atari games** (Bricks, Space invaders, etc.) by Google DeepMind, using the pixel images displayed on the screen as input to decide what action to take to achieve the highest possible score at the end of the game
*   the **victory in the game of Go**, by the same team, over the best human player in a series of five games
*   **automatic description of the content of an image** ("[An image speaks louder than a thousand words](http://googleresearch.blogspot.fr/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html)"), also by Google
*   **the results of [Imagenet's Large Scale Visualisation Challenge 2012](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/results.html)**, won by a very large convolutional neural network developed by the University of Toronto, and trained with Nvidia GPUs
*   the quality of **facial recognition systems** such as those of Facebook
*   aso.

But this is only a very small part of what AI has achieved. **The advances in robotics, autonomous vehicles, speech processing and natural language understanding are equally impressive**.  
Examples include:

*   the skill level achieved by robots in [Darpa's Robotic Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge), won by KAIST in 2015. In this competition, robots must drive a utility vehicle, open a door and enter a building, close a valve, use a tool to drill through a wall, move through rubble or remove debris blocking an entrance door and climb a ladder;
*   **speech understanding.** It is now considered a standard feature of smartphones and tablets with artificial companions such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana or Facebook's M;
*   **Instant translation.** Microsoft Skype Translator translates conversations in different languages in real time;
*   **driverless vehicles.** Autonomous cars have travelled thousands of kilometres without major incidents.

Equally fundamental are the results obtained in **areas such as knowledge representation and reasoning, ontologies and other technologies for the semantic web and the web of data:**

*   **Google Knowledge Graph** improves search results by displaying structured data on requested search terms or phrases;
*   **Schema.org** contains millions of RDF triples describing known facts: search engines can use this data to provide structured information on demand;
*   #Facebook uses the **OpenGraph protocol** - based on RDFa - to allow any web page to become an enriched object in a social graph.

Finally, another important trend is the **recent opening up of several previously proprietary technologies** so that the AI research community can not only benefit from them, but also contribute to enriching them with new features.  

Examples include:

*   **IBM Watson's cognitive services,** available on programmatic interfaces (APIs), which offer up to twenty different technologies such as Speech To Text and Text To Speech services, concept identification and linkage, visual recognition and many others;
*   [Google's TensorFlow Software Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=en) used for machine learning, which has been made open source;
*   Facebook's release of its open source [Big Sur server](https://engineering.fb.com/) design for running large deep learning neural networks on GPUs

The enthusiasm generated by all these positive achievements has, however, been tempered by the concerns expressed here and there by leading scientists.
