#### Image and handwriting recognition

In the original version of IAI Mooc, focused conferences about applied AI were proposed to introduce debates on AI. Focuses on such applied tools like image recognition and hanwriting recognition or other applied AI tools could be selected for the pilot phase.

**Summary of the upcoming conference:**  
How can an artificial intelligence recognise an image, a symbol or a handwritten letter?  
How can it decide what it "sees" and find meaning based on the context it is given?  
Can a neural network really learn to read?  
We will see how to go from recognising an isolated character to analysing a complete line of text.

Research project: [**RECITAL**](http://recital.univ-nantes.fr/#/)

The [RECITAL platform](http://recital.univ-nantes.fr/#/) is a unique participatory transcription tool for the **RE**records of the **Ital**ian Comedy of 18th century Paris. This platform offers professionals and curious neophytes alike the opportunity to contribute to the marking, transcription and verification of thousands of pages of manuscript documents. This allows us to revise the state of our knowledge on the economy of the spectacle and the entire cultural history of the 18th century.

In the framework of this project, the IPI (Image Perception Interaction) team of the LS2N is working on systems for the automatic recognition of handwriting in these ancient documents.
