#### Pedagogical activity

This learning activity was kept because it proposes to identify artificial intelligence in everyday devices or services/applications. These elements can be reorganised in a way that is more suitable for the mooc audience.

To begin the session, the facilitator can show the young people the first part of the **["questioning yourself" video from module#1](/jump_to_id/fb74be0b63a2427fbfa76d2e822a0a76) (up to the "who's afraid of AI" card)**.  
Once the video has been viewed, the facilitator can question the young people, asking them what they think of Guillaume's and his cousin Theo's thoughts?

To go further, the facilitator can start by asking the group about **the representations** they have of Artificial Intelligence (AI):

*   Is an AI a super intelligence? And for that matter, is AI really intelligent?
*   Is a robot necessarily an AI?
*   Do they think there is AI in social networks?
*   Is a computer more intelligent than a human being?

This first time of reflection can moreover take the form of a "**moving debate**".  
The space is graduated according to the opinion of the young people, from _"I totally agree"_ to _"I totally disagree"_. Each person is then invited to position themselves individually and to argue their choice of position. **The aim being to launch a debate to feed the group's collective reflections**.

The facilitator can also present a set of **technologies** and ask the group if they think these technologies work with AI or not. For example:

*   Does Facebook work with AI?  
    _Yes, in fact, it is a prominent French AI researcher, Yann Lecun, who heads FAIR, Facebook's fundamental AI research hub._
*   Does a microwave contain AI?  
    _No, it is a machine, that is, a mechanical device designed to perform a specific task, to heat up our food._
*   Does a robot work with AI?  
    _Not necessarily, it is possible for a robot to work with an artificial intelligence program but it doesn't have to. A robot is first and foremost a mechanical device consisting of electrical circuits, sensors and receivers._
*   Does the scrabble game my grandfather plays on his computer work with AI?  
    _If the grandfather in question is playing against the computer, and not against other grandpas connected online, then yes, this scrabble game does use artificial intelligence._
*   Is there artificial intelligence in my mobile phone?  
    _Yes, AI is actually behind many of its features: facial recognition, voice recognition, word prediction when writing a text message... These are all features that are implemented with artificial intelligence._

The aim of this game (which is proposer by [CS4FN](http://www.cs4fn.org/sitemap/sitemap.php) from Queen Mary University ) is to get two people to play against each other in a game of tic-tac-toe. One of them takes on the role of the machine, and in this context has at his disposal a "smart paper" with a series of instructions. The second player plays the role of the human being. The person in the role of the machine will always win the game thanks to the instructions on the "smart paper". When this observation has been made, the question can be raised : "the machine certainly wins every time but is following a sequence of instructions really being intelligent?"
