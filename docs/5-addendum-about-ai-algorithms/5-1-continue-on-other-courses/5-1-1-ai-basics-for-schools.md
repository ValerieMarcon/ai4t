#### "AI Basics for School" Mooc

Other online ressources could be mentionned as good follow-up to this Mooc.

This AI Basics for Schools Mooc is part of the [EU Code Week initiative](https://codeweek.eu/), supported by the European Commission. 

This course is now archived, which means that

1.  you can access the course content,
2.  but the animation of the Mooc is over  (no certificates can be issued, and the course team is no longer able to answer learners' questions).

The objectives of this Mooc and its target audience make it an interesting complement to our own content. It is teacher-oriented and provides examples of effective use of AI in education or helps teachers to integrate AI-related activities into the classroom.
