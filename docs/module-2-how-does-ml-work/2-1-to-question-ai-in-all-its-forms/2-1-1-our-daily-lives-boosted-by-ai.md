### Our Daily Lives Boosted by AI

Many of the technologies we use now work with artificial intelligence. They use two types of AI software applications: a "recognition" system and/or a prediction system.

A **recognition system** identifies and classifies all the data submitted to it. It can recognise an image, a face, a sound, a word, etc. Such a system increases the functionality of our smartphone applications, search engines or social networking software. Thanks to recognition systems, an application can now identify a person's photos and classify them in a dedicated album. This is also what allows search engine translators such as Google to automatically identify the original language of a word that is being translated.

The **predictive system**, on the other hand, makes it possible to predict future events or behaviour, such as the weather forecast, based on a mass of data. It is, for example, widely used on social networks and online sales sites to target advertisements to users. Based on your data (age, gender, place of residence, interests, recent online purchases, recent searches, etc.) the algorithm determines the purchases you are most likely to make in the coming days and offers you advertising based on this data.

Depending on the way we use these AI technologies, it may be more of a "gimmick" than a real "innovation". But in many areas it has led to impressive technical progress. This is what is presented in the book "Artificial Intelligence - Investigating the technologies that are changing our lives" 1. Among other things, these tools are set to revolutionise the fields of:

*   **Medicine:** we are moving towards what the Leroy Hood Institute defined in 2013 as "P4 medicine". That is to say, medicine that would be "preventive", "participative", "personalised" and "predictive". Some of the new technologies are simple bots that can make a pre-diagnosis without any examination, just by looking at people's digital traces... Other technologies allow doctors to better detect breast cancer. This is crucial because when breast cancer is diagnosed in its early stages, it has a better chance of being cured.

*   **The media:** short articles can now be produced automatically. Far from being able to claim a press card, this simplistic technology, which produces texts devoid of journalistic style and analysis, perhaps shows that many human-written articles are ultimately no more sophisticated. Nevertheless, the technology is a time-saver, and some media outlets have used the programme to produce texts on the 2014 and 2015 municipal and departmental elections in France to make up for staff shortages.

*   **Justice:** AnaCrim data analysis software has been helping the French gendarmerie for many years. Made famous in 2017 when it was used in well known case in France of child assassination, this software is used when a criminal investigation includes many elements to be analysed and dated, to provide elements to assist human decisions.

*   **The creative arts** (cinema, music, film, etc.): whether for composing music or enhancing cinematic special effects, algorithms have long been present in the arts and culture. Artificial intelligence mechanisms are also used in cooking, to predict recipes that are more likely to please customers or to create new tastes and flavours.


These new technologies, boosted by artificial intelligence, are already enabling new technical and scientific progress and these algorithms are also widely used in research. However, the use of our data in these technologies and the potential risks linked to the intrusion into our private lives and to mass surveillance must be questioned and debated. Tasting a pizza prepared by an algorithm, why not, but can we accept to let an algorithm decide the amount of our credits or the judgment of a court case, without human discernment?
