#### Final Survey: Your Experience and Opinion

As for the questionnaire at the beginning of the mooc, a co-construction work is to be planned with the WP3 - Evaluation.  
Moreover, it is important to make the link between these questionnaires & the Methodological Framework (deliverable 2.1 of our WP2) in order to ensure the alignment of the evaluated elements with the objectives formalised by the WP2 Steering Group.

We need your feedback to help us improve **future sessions of this MOOC. Thank you for taking this survey!**

This questionnaire is offered by FUN with specific questions at the end about this MOOC. **Thank you for your contribution to the FUN network.**
