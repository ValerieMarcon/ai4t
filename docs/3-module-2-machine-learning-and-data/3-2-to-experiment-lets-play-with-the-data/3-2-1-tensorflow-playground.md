### Play with the Machine's Neurons

This activity was dedicated to discovering TensorFlow, an "end-to-end open source platform for machine learning". It can be replaced by an activity in English that is easier to implement for in-depth discovery of machine learning softwares.

_The online software **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview/)** allows to build artificial neural networks and to test their responses for different types of problems and on different types of data. In the "Classification" problem type, the objective is to separate blue and orange coloured points. An application of this type of problem is, for example, a photo classification algorithm. In the example below, there is one input (feature) that separates the points horizontally and another that separates vertically. The result (output) is well adapted to the type of data chosen (data)._
