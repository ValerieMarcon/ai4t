### Let's Play with Data

The original IAI Mooc proposed several activities:  
\- an image recognition algorithm which is fed with different sets of deliberately biased data. This actvity is in link with the previous tutorial "Boosted with AI?".  
\- How can you can get a machine to learn, using activity sheets to understand the basics of AI learning through practice. The activity is targeted for young audience.  
  
They can be replaced by activities that are relevant to the AI4T audience (whether or not in linked to the project disciplines: Maths/Stem and Language).
