#### You have just completed this first module, congratulations!

### What resources have contributed to your knowledge of AI?

This second poll is an opportunity to further question the learners' experience during the Mooc.  
In the original IAI Mooc, the questionnaire focused on the resources offered (videos, fact sheets, texts, activities). The learners were asked to give their opinion on the relevance of these resources to their learning process, i.e. which resources seemed to be the most useful in their acculturation to AI.  
As for the first poll, we will have to discuss with WP3 partners what use they might make of this or whether it is strictly for WP2 use.
