#### AI Just to Play With! 1/2

This section proposes to look at two AI-enabled tools and to look at what they can do, and how (in a very general way). These tools could be replaced, others could be added.

Pl@ntNet

![plant à identify](/static/IAI-jeu-plantnet.jpg)

[Pl@ntNet](https://plantnet.org/en/) is an image-based plant identification system.

This is a participatory science and research project, which works by comparing visual patterns transmitted by users via photos of plant organs (flowers, fruits, leaves…) that they are trying to identify. These images are analysed and compared with a bank of images produced collaboratively and enriched daily. The system then proposes a possible list of species with their illustrations.

The system then proposes a possible list of species with their illustrations.

This system currently operates on over 22,000 plant species. The list of recognisable species is growing steadily thanks to contributions from the community and the integration of expert databases.

Pl@ntNet can be tested as an application or without downloading it directly in its Web version.
