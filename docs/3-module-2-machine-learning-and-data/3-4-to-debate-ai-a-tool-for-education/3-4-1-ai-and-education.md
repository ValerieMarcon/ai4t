#### AI and Education: Issues, Tools and Perspectives

In the original version of IAI Mooc, debates about AI and Education were organized.  
  
They focused on:  
\- Artificial intelligence and the human mind: what are we talking about?  
\- Using AI mechanisms to learn better: what is possible? what tools really work? what are the limits?  
\- Learning differently because of AI: how can a better understanding of AI mechanisms lead to a better understanding of human learning?  
\- Learning from AI: what to teach children and citizens? for what societal issues?  
  
Such topics could be addressed for AI4T pilot phase with adapted resources in English or activitiesÂ  to illustrate tools and use of AI in Education.

### AI as a Tool for Education

In the future, artificial intelligence will be capable of adapting learning to the real skills of students, and this is what gives rise to fantasies, enthusiasm and concern. What can AI do for education? And under what scientific and ethical conditions can we imagine its development in our schools?

Could be added resources in English to illustrate those subjects In link with the outcome of Objective 3:  
\- Learning robot for AI education  
\- Student Clustering  
\- KidLearn: Assessment and personalisation of learning on https://flowers.inria.fr/research/kidlearn/
