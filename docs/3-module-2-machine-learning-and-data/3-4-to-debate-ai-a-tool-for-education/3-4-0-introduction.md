AI as a tool for better learning
--------------------------------

This is the first one we think of, using algorithms to provide tools for better learning. Of course, there are also a lot of myths and beliefs that need to be overcome to make this first idea a reality.

The key point is **adaptive learning**.

The key point is **adaptive learning** thanks to “learning traces” measurements, that is, the learner's results. If the learner's results (his or her results from questionnaires, his or her interaction with the software, etc.), the system will modify its operation (particularly through the selection of content) to try to adapt to the person. Even if the scientific foundations are not yet totally stabilised, it is also possible to exploit an analysis of one's behaviour via the use of sensors (from a camera on one's mobile phone to brain-computer interfaces in a computer); This principle of adaptation is most often found in a playful and individual context (educational game with the machine), but also exists in other situations (for example with several people).

This implies, in advance, an often colossal amount of work to **completely formalise the knowledge and know-how acquired**. This formalisation is in itself interesting, as it obliges the skills, knowledge and practices that enable them to be acquired to be well explained and structured. However, care must be taken not to over-organise learning, which remains a complex cognitive task in all cases.

Moreover, this approach requires working in a digital learning context that comes with well-known constraints (hardware needs, software training, limits to the use of screens, etc.).

Several pedagogical impacts of this algorithmic learning can be mentioned. First of all, it generally leads to a better engagement of the learner, because interacting with the content in a different way offers an additional chance to understand it well. Moreover, the machine does not judge (like a human), which can help maintain this commitment. Secondly, and probably more importantly, the fact that the difficulty is adapted to the learner makes it possible to limit or even avoid discouragement or weariness; this type of learning does, however, require a greater cognitive investment. Finally, if the play aspect is too important, one should not overlook the risk of losing focus instead of investing in the expected learning;

The use of these new tools leads the teacher's role to change. Thus, taking advantage of the fact that his class is more involved in autonomous learning activities, he has more time to individualise his teaching practice with the pupils who need it most. In addition, it allows the teacher to free himself from part of the task of passing on knowledge or accompanying the acquisition of know-how, with multi-media content, as in reverse education; The focus should be on other pedagogical approaches, such as project-based learning. Compared to classical digital tools, without AI, the degree of autonomous learning can be much higher and more widely applied (e.g. with self-correcting exercises and complete skill acquisition paths). These tools are particularly topical in situations of distance learning (health crisis), and question the organisation of school working time.

So, it is important to be aware of the importance of this type of training.

Human societies that have such tools are not immune to the risks: the omnipresent and omnipotent tracing of learners, which allows them to be identified (especially when these traces are linked to those of other facets of their behaviour: purchases, video/reading consultations, etc.), the temptation to return to the same subject. ...), the temptation to reduce the human offer in terms of education, the reinforcement of inequalities in relation to illectronism, aso...

AI as a tool to better understand how we learn

The ability to measure these learning traces not only provides a tool to improve a person's learning immediately, but also provides sources of measurements to better understand human learning. These learning traces are recorded during the use of software (measurement of mouse movements, keyboard entries, etc.), but also through the use of a computer. ), but also thanks to sensors used in educational situations without a computer (e.g. physical activity in a school yard, observed with visual or body sensors). Exploiting these measures then requires not only formalising the learning task itself, but also modelling the learner (not in his or her globality, of course, but in the context of the task).

It should be noted that these **machine learning algorithms** are based on rather sophisticated models. They are not necessarily limited to supervised learning mechanisms where the answers are adjusted from examples provided with the solution, but also work by reinforcement, i.e., when the machine is not able to find the answer; This means that when learning is based on simple positive feedback (compensates) or negative feedback, the system must infer the causes that lead to this feedback, sometimes by building an internal model of the task. Or mechanisms that best adjust exploratory behaviour (described as divergent) on the one hand and behaviour that exploits what is acquired (described as convergent) on the other. These models are operational, i.e. they allow the creation of effective algorithms that learn. It is fascinating to wonder to what extent these models could also represent human learning. In neuroscience, these so-called computational models (which represent processes in the form of calculation or information processing mechanisms) are already widely used to explain the functioning of the brain at the neuronal level. In this context, it would be more abstract at the cognitive level.

This field is still in its infancy and exploratory research actions combining educational sciences, digital sciences (including symbolic and digital artificial intelligence) and cognitive neurosciences are being developed.

AI as a subject and object of instruction
-----------------------------------------

Of course, in order to master the digital world and not only consume it, at the risk of becoming a docile or even cruel user, it is necessary to understand how it all works, both at the technical and the application level.

Understand, for example, that these algorithms are not programmed explicitly with the help of instructions, but by providing data from which they adjust their parameters. Or to understand at the application level the legal consequences of having in one's environment a cobot, i.e. a robotic mechanism interacting with our daily life. This system is almost never anthropomorphic (i.e. having a form approaching that of a human), it is a machine that is designed to be used in a variety of ways; For example, a medical machine will have to make urgent therapeutic decisions about the health of a person that the machine is monitoring. This example shows that the chain of responsibility between design, construction, installation, parameterisation and use is very different from that of a machine that operates without an algorithm, and whose behaviour is therefore not partially autonomous.

This MOOC is also drafted as a way to contribute to this citizen education.

**But it is also an _object_ of instruction which _transforms_ what we have to teach.**

In fact, the mobilisation of so-called intelligent processes is changing our vision of human intelligence: we are seeing the machine learning tasks that we would have qualified as intelligent if we had performed them ourselves. We will therefore have less need to learn skills that we will no longer be able to perform, but more need to get a sense of what the mechanisms are doing for us (i.e. calculating on numbers but also on symbols).

This is a very concrete subject. For example, with calculators, do we still need to learn to calculate? No, we need to learn a little bit to develop our mind, and understand what happens when an arithmetic operation is performed, but we will need to practice calculating; However, we will need to practise calculating orders of magnitude, to check that there is no error in the calculation, or to ensure that the calculation itself is relevant. Similarly, with automatic translators, language learning is going to change a lot, especially with less of a need to know how to translate word for word, but more of a need to take a step back from the meaning and the way of expressing oneself, or not, which is a real open subject.

Finally, if we are content to use AI algorithms without trying to understand their main operating principles and the implications they have on our lives, we will lose individual and collective intelligence: we will rely on their mechanisms and do less thinking for ourselves.  
On the contrary, if we seek to understand and master these processes, then the possibility of harnessing some of the intelligence offers us a chance to free ourselves in full consciousness of these now mundane tasks in order to devote our human intelligence to higher purposes, and to consider more humanly important issues.
