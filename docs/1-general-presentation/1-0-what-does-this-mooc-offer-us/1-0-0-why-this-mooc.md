#### A citizen's mini-training course that demystifies without simplifying

If the objective of the training is indeed to reach a large neophyte public with fun activities, videos and texts, the team of experts who designed it emphasizes above all rigorous knowledge allowing to build a correct and operational vision on AI and its issues.

Used by everyone from now on, the term "artificial intelligence" needs to be explained and understood in order to be able to appropriate it and to take the necessary distance from the numerous preconceived ideas on the subject. While recalling that artificial intelligence must be at the service of humans, the new MOOC from Class'Code's partners deciphers, step by step, the challenges and technological levers related to AI. The course aims to present the principles of machine learning and defines technical terms such as deep learning, as well as the crucial role of mastering data sets. Through an interactive course, the aim is to share a minimal culture on the subject and to give everyone the ability to better master the use of these technologies.
