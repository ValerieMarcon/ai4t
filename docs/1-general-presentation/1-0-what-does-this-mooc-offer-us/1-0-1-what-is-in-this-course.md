### What is in this Course? How is it Organised?

_The relevance of this original presentation of IAI Mooc is to be considered in line with the hybridization models that will be defined with the partners and the Methodological Framework (D2.1) of the AI4T Project._


### The MOOC is organised in 3 Modules:

 **Module 1: What is meant by AI?**

This first part is dedicated to the acquisition of a first understanding of what is meant by Artificial Intelligence, what it is not and finally raises the question: What is intelligence ?

**Module 2: Machine Learning and Data**

**Module 3: Humans and AI**

This third part deals with the problems of ethics and aims to understand the stakes and the levers for AI to be at the service of humans.

#### Each module is articulated in 3 steps:

*   To Question Yourself: to move from preconceived ideas to questions on which to build understanding.
*   To Experiment: to perform  activity (on line or not) and see for yourself.
*   To Discover: to understand how it works through the history of humans and their ideas.

At the end of each module, directly on the FUN platform, **theoretical exercises (quizzes)** and **practical exercises (AI that can be played)** are offered to you to reinforce the knowledge and skills acquired.
