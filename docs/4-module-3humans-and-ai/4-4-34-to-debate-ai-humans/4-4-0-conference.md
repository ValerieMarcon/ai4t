Conference theme to be adapted with other resources.  
Below is the conference presentation of the original IAI Mooc.

In the presence of **[Ikram Chraibi Kaadoud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikramchraibik/)**, PhD in Computer Science and [**Frédéric Alexandre**](https://www.labri. fr/perso/falexand/), Inria research director, this webinar addresses questions around the **reliability** and **explicability** of AI:

*   In what ways are current mechanisms opaque and difficult to interpret, is this the case for all AI tools?
*   What is the explicability of AI?
*   What is the degree of reliability of these mechanisms, how do they compare with human reliability?
*   How will these tools work?
*   How will these interpretable and explainable calculations work in practice and what impact will they have on us?

**About interpretability and explicability:**  
_Interpretability_ consists of providing information representing both the reasoning of the algorithm and the internal representation of the data in a format interpreted by an expert.  
_Explainability_ is the process of providing information in a format that is self-sufficient and accessible to a user, whether a novice or a technophile, and regardless of expertise.
