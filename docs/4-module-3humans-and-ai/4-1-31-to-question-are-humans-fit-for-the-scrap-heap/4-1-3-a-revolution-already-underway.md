#### A Revolution already Underway

The technological and digital revolution has already impacted our lives and our jobs. Some professions have already disappeared, others have already been created. Community manager, data journalist, web designer... all these professions did not exist (or at least not in this form) ten, twenty or thirty years ago, or more recently the professions relating to data (data analyst, data scientist, data architect, data journalist...) which will continue to develop.

**Two phenomena** tend to reinforce the technological and digital revolution:

> *   **complete automation** This is the total execution of a task by a machine or a programme. Here, employees are replaced by machines.
> *   **professional increase** i.e. the provision of tools new software or hardware that would make tasks less demanding for the human being, or allow to focus on other aspects of the mission...

For example, a train driver is easily replaceable, as his position can be completely replaced by an automated one. An aeroplane pilot, if he or she uses a mode of piloting automatic, is still essential in view of the task.

These two related phenomena of automation and augmentation are probably what will change the world of employment in the years to come. At the same time, professions that have a more empathetic and human dimension would not be impacted a priori. Such as those in the social and solidarity economy sector. Machines cannot be empathetic or committed. Solidarity or humanitarian associations, or people involved in supporting and helping people, do not have to fear obsolescence.
