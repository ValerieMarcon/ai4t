#### Will History Prove the Schumpeterians Right Again?

For the economist Joseph Schumpeter, any technological innovation, if it leads to the disappearance of certain professions, creates a multitude of new ones. This is called "creative destruction". This is what was observed at the time of the automobile revolution. Cars certainly made the carriages disappear (and the profession of coachman at the same time), but in return, they led to the creation of all the professions of the automobile. Mechanics, garage owners, dealers... all these professions owe their existence to the industrial revolution of the 19th century.

This argument brandished by the followers of **the Schumpeterian theory** must however be put into perspective. For example, the equity desk of the famous American investment bank Goldman Sachs now has only two traders out of the 600 it employed at its peak in the 2000s. They have all been replaced by algorithms (and some 200 engineers). The same happened with the mechanisation of agriculture, or the arrival of office automation, which led to the disappearance of professions such as stenographer-typist.

We have two alternatives:

*   To think that while technical progress may have caused unemployment, it has always created more jobs than it has destroyed.
*   To think that the digital revolution is qualitatively different from those we have experienced before.

Robotisation and the automation of cognitive processes will eventually replace the vast majority of the professions we know today, without requiring a lot of additional support activity. The solution would then lie in a more social distribution of wealth. Thus, the future of working people would lie in the creation of a universal income, or in the taxation of companies that own the robots that have replaced these jobs.

So, destructive creation or creative destruction? It is impossible to ask an artificial intelligence to give the answer! So let's trust this fact: humans have always sought to innovate primarily to improve their existence, not to constrain it.

If there is one point, however, on which all specialists agree, it is that there is a need to integrate more into initial and continuing education the fundamental learning linked to the transformations that the development of artificial intelligence and digital technologies will bring. Scientific innovations and the technological revolution we are currently experiencing are transforming our societies, as did previous ones. If people are to evolve in these societies, solutions must be guaranteed so that they are not excluded or marginalised. It is therefore necessary for each and every one of us to understand the foundations for mastering technologies and not just consuming them, or even undergoing them. In order to avoid creating what are known as "useless people", education and training professionals must quickly offer resources that include the possibility of orienting or reorienting oneself towards new knowledge or professions, but also a civic education... like the one you are currently following!
