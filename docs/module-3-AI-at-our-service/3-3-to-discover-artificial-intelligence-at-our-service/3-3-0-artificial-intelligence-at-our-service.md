The development of computer science in general and artificial intelligence in particular raises ethical questions that are very different from those posed, since Hippocrate, by the development of life sciences and medicine. Traditional values, such as respect for privacy, transparency, intelligibility... are to be rethought.

####Synopsis
The main character, Guillaume, reminds us of the challenges of AI in a very wide range of fields.Â He emphasises that this reflection on artificial intelligence also leads us to reflect on human intelligence. And this reflection leads to a questioning of humanity and our role as citizens in society.
The discussion with the hotline then focuses on the notion of creativity and its unique link with human intelligence. And just as AIs cannot create but only imitate, they cannot feel emotions but only imitate the manifestations of our emotions.
It is then stated that AIs are valuable decision support tools, in a wide variety of fields. However, these AIs can have flaws, and it is important that we know what they contain (i.e. which algorithms and which data) which is not so easy.
This observation leads Guillaume and the hotline to end their discussions on the conditions of a trustworthy AI and its stakes in our lives as human beings and citizens.
