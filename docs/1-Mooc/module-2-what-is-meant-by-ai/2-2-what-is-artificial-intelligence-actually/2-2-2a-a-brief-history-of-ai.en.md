# Activity: A brief history of AI

## Natural Interaction, Image Recognition and Autonomous Car Applications

Natural Interaction, Image Recognition and Autonomous Car are the 3 technologies commonly mentioned as AI applications:

- Natural Interaction applications are based on natural language communication and processing (NLP) techniques which are used for: speech recognition and production, chatbot, voice assistant, automatic text summarisation, term extraction, machine translation, etc.

- Image Recognition applications are based on computer vision techniques which are used for: face recognition, visual diagnostics, handwriting recognition, etc.

- Autonomous cars are the result of integration and interaction technologies and combine several techniques: perception, reasoning, action, learning and interaction with the environment.

## Where do they come from?

In the following activity you will make the link between some scientific advances and AI-based technologies possibly used in Education (Natural Interaction, Image Recognition). Autonomous Car will be presented as an example of what is expected of AI.
