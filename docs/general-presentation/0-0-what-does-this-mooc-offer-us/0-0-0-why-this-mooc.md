#### Why This Mooc?

Used by everyone from now on, the term "artificial intelligence" needs to be explained and understood in order to be able to appropriate it and to take the necessary distance from the numerous preconceived ideas on the subject.  
The objective of this online resource is to share a minimal culture on Artificial Intelligence, or rather AI components, in particular in the school context, and to give everyone the possibility to better master the issues and the use of these technologies.

#### A content based on IAI Class'Code Mooc

This online ressource is essentially based on the content of the French Mooc "[L'Intelligence Artificielle... avec intelligence!](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/cours/lintelligence-artificielle-avec-intelligence/)" available on Fun Mooc and produced in 2020 by Class'Code, Inria, Magic Maker, S24B l'Interactive, with the participation of 4minutes34, Data Bingo, the University of Nantes, La Compagnie du Code, La Ligue de l'enseignement and the support of the French Ministry of National Education and Youth, UNIT, EducAzur and leblob.fr.
