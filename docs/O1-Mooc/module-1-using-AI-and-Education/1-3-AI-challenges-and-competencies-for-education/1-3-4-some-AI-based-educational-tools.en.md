# Some AI-based Educational Tools
A lot of Educational Technology (Edtech) companies and research institutes invest in AI-based tools and software to facilitate teaching
and learning, from Intelligent Tutoring Systems to more specific applications like automatic test generation or foreign language
learning. Yet most of these AI in Education (AIEd) tools are only beginning to be used in the classroom by pupils and teachers.

## AI-based tools already experimented in the classroom

In 2021 a survey of K12 education in Europe  listed some AIEd tools that have been created as part of international or national projects and
shared under creative commons licences or as open educational resources[^1], among which:

-   [Lalilo](https://p2ia.lalilo.com/)(FR): adaptive learning to read

-   [Adaptiv'Math](https://www.adaptivmath.fr/)(FR): a teaching assistant for teaching and adaptive learning for mathematics

## Other examples of AI-based resources related to language learning and maths
A lot of other tools can be found on the Web. Here are some of them.

[Duolingo for Schools](https://schools.duolingo.com): A free management layer on top of the Duolingo language learning application to
get visibility and a level of control over the students' experience on Duolingo.

[Adaptiv'langue](https://specimen.adaptivlangue.evidenceb.com/)(FR): Each student completes a diagnostic test in which the teacher is
informed of the student's level and that of the class in the skills being worked on. The student's progress in the application is
determined by his or her success rate in the exercises that are proposed to help him or her progress without demotivating him or her.

[EF Hello](https://www.hello.ef.com/) or [AndyChatbot](https://andychatbot.com/)(EN): Mobile Apps for learners to have conversations in English as a foreign language

[AXIÎ¸ME](https://axiome.ai/)(FR): Teaching assistant to diagnose gaps in mathematics and personalise the learning paths of pupils from 11
to 18.

[Checkmath](https://checkmath.com/)(EN): Support for mathematics learning on mobile phone for pupils from 11 to 13.

[Photomath](https://photomath.com): Mathematical solver using on mobile phone to scan, recognize and display solving steps of the maths
problem.

## How to find your way through the multitude of educational resources on offer?
AI-based tools like those mentioned above are at the core of AI in Education. A template to analyse the characteristics of these tools at
the scientific, technical, regulatory, and ethical levels, will be proposed later in this training. The objective is to give teachers a
better understanding of the resources they use or that their students use.
