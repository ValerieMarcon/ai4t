# Activity: Tutorial Let's test our first program

What is AI and how does an AI program work?

Image recognition is an area of AI that has seen considerable growth[^1]. This tutorial proposes to test image recognition and to train a program to recognize cats and docs. Then it reminds us that this program can only do what it has been trained to do, and that it can be fooled!

In this tutorial are inserted 7 very short pedagogical videos which make the tutorials usable with an audience of high school (or secondary school) students if desired.

**Note**: This tutorial does not store any personal data. The images are processed locally on the user's machine. It can be used with the following browsers: Edge, Chrome, Mozilla, Safari, Opera

Go ahead and train an AI!
