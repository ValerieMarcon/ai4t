# Activity: A brief history of AI

The origin of Natural Interaction, Image Recognition and Autonomous Car applications.

Natural Interaction, Image Recognition and Autonomous Car are 3 technologies commonly mentioned as AI applications.

Natural Interaction applications are based on natural language communication and processing (NLP) techniques which are used for: speech recognition and production, chatbot, voice assistant, automatic text summarisation, term extraction, machine translation, etc.

Image Recognition applications are based on computer vision techniques which are used for: face recognition, visual diagnostics, handwriting recognition, etc.

Autonomous cars result from the transversal domain of integration and interaction technologies combining several technologies: perception, reasoning, action, learning and interaction with the environment.

In the following activity you will discover the scientific advances at the origin of three AI-based technologies: Natural Interaction, Image Recognition and Autonomous Car.
